# Church-Membership-101
A '101' document for church membership. Includes Statement of Faith, Constitution, By-laws, and Covenant Agreement.

Taken from the new members' packet from my church, this document will hopefully provide other churches with a launching point for creating their own statements of faith, constitutions, by-laws, covenant agreements and/or member on-boarding processes.
